# How to request your own USRBG banner

Join [Black Box Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb) and follow the instructions in [#usrbg-guide-and-requests](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/886287835018178560).

All requests are processed manually by a select few moderators. You should expect to wait a decent amount of time before your background is approved.

Do not ask me about getting banned in Black Box, I am not even in the server.
